    <td><details><summary></summary>Refer to the instructions provided in the box. Mount the axle in a horizontal position in any standard clamp. Insert a string through one of the holes and secure it. Insert another string through another hole and secure it. Hang different weights from the strings to balance the wheel. The Wheel and Axle is used to show the relationship and significance of various pulley diameters when used in a mechanical system. The GS-301 consists of a molded wheel with four individual pulleys of different diameters. The ratios of these diameters is a sequence of approximately 3, 2,  1.5, and  1. The ratios are not exact because of mold wear through the years and the shrinkage of the plastic as it cools after the molding process. They are, however, within five percent. To begin, mount the wheel to the axle in a horizontal position using any standard laboratory post and clamp system. Note that there is a small hole drilled in each pulley level. This is to allow a piece of string to be inserted and secured on the back side with a knot or by tying it around a short piece of match stick or other suitable material. Now take several turns around the pulley and hang a weight on the end of the string. Repeat this at another pulley level, winding the string in the opposite direction. Now determine how much weight must be added to balance the wheel and keep it from turning. One simple way to do this is to attach a large paper clip to the end of each string and to then hang small washers on this "hook" until you have achieved balance. Now simply count the number of washers and it will be found that their ratio is the same as the ratio of the pulley diameters. INS  5078-A lf you want to work with actual pulley diameters, wrap a piece of string around the pulley and put a pencil mark across any two adjacent turns. Measure the length between marks and divide by pi. There are other ways of using the wheel and axle to show the mechanical  advantage of various pulley diameters. For instance, it can be used on a level surface to pull a block against friction. lt can also be used to slide a block or roll a cart up an inclined plane.</details></td>

It has the measurement range and strength to accommodate people of all sizes and the sensitivity to measure smaller forces such as the weight of a ball. Put the platform on the floor or tabletop to measure vertical force, or mount it on a wall to measure horizontal force. With the optional handle set, you can use the platform to measure both “pulling” and “pushing” force.</details></td>
